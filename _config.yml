  As followers of Christ, we are called to engage the world around us with the unchanging gospel message. We walk with Christ in times of joy, hope, fear, loss and reconciliation. We love for our neighbors and our Creator. Computers have connected and united Christians around the globe. New technology has helped us deeper understand what it means to live life according to scripture. Without faith-focused engineering; scientific tools can be misued, dishonor God, and devalue our fellow image-bearers. Evangelical Christians hold fast to the inerrant and infallible Word of God, which states that every human being is made in Godâ€™s image and thus has infinite value and worth in the eyes of their Creator.The work we do, and the message we bear is in his glory. M2237.co does AI research and advocacy to preserve the message of Christ and the Word of God for the future. /n/n                       Matthew 28:18-20
